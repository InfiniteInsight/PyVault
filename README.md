# PyVault

This is just a small project intended to be a practice exercise with python, javascript/typescript, docker, k8s and hashi vault.

Onward!

left off:
docker-compose up --build

need to:

implement CRUD operations for secrets
implement graphical dashboard
seal/unseal
initialize/deinitialize
update version

run docker build -t

apply k8s manifests

.env files are included in this repo with the understanding that this should not happen in a serious repository, they are sensitive but this is just practice with languages and vault.
